**Keynote Speech: Mission as Kingdom Transformation**

We, as individuals, are transformed through the gospel of Jesus Christ.  As communities of believers (churches), we are transformed to live in reconciliation and love. Then in the power of the Spirit, we become God's instruments of transformation in the world as salt and light. This is kingdom transformation. It is not so much that by being missional we are transformed. Although that happens, it is not the primary emphasis. Rather God transforms us, then we become His instruments of transformation.<br>

**Message 1: Kingdom Transformation of Individuals, Churches, and Communities**
1.  Transformation of individuals into kingdom citizens
2.  Transformation of churches into kingdom communities
3.  Transformation of communities through God’s kingdom people

**Message 2: The Surprising Influence of Kingdom Transformation**
1. Two Metaphors: Salt & Light
2. Two Parables: A Mustard Seed & Yeast

<details>
 <summary> A1: Holistic Mission in Asia - History of the Expansion of Christianity into Asia </summary>

In my workshop, I will share two historical examples of integral (or holistic) mission in Asia
dating from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century. First, I focus on Xi Shengmo, a former
opium addict, who after a dramatic conversion, became a key Chinese pastor associated with the
China Inland Mission. Pastor Xi’s ministry included supervision of a large group of CIM
missionaries, as well as pioneer evangelism in Shanxi province. He founded forty opium refuges,
which served as centers for church planting. He also wrote numerous hymns. The second
historical example explores the ministry of Pandita Ramabai, a high-caste Hindu woman. Before
her conversion, Ramabai gained notoriety as a Hindu scholar and as an advocate for oppressed
women in India. After her conversion, she founded the Mukti Mission to combine ministry to
oppressed girls and women with evangelistic outreach. Ramabai and her colleague launched a
Bible women training center at Mukti. The trained women were sent out to local villages to
evangelize, teach the Bible, distribute Scriptures, and form Sunday schools. A major revival
broke out at the Mukti Mission, which further impacted the whole region. </details>

<details>
<summary> A2: 整全宣教與散聚宣教 - 成為宣教導向的挑戰 </summary>

在當今全球人口遷移的時代，許多來自於世界各地的移民出現在你我居住的社區，「家門口的宣教」在傳統的海外宣教差派模式以外，成為北美華人宣教事工一個另類的重要方向。散聚宣教的理念是一個以會友主導，與宣教對象大量接觸互動的宣教思維，它也是整全宣教最自然發揮的事工環境。「以整全宣教的理念從事於散聚宣教的發展」將是本專題的重點，涉及到針對宣教對象的全人關懷，福音整全的表達，教會跨代的動員等。藉著不同的個案研究，本專題也會探討北美華人教會從事這類的宣教事工方向，在成為宣教導向的前提下，可能面對的挑戰。</details>

**講員 Speaker：[王欽慈牧師/博士](#王欽慈牧師博士)**
<details>
<summary> A3: 從創造到新創造 - 關愛受造界的神學 </summary>

我們常常聽到這樣的論點：「教會應該專注於傳福音，而不是關注創造物的保護。我們的首要任務應該是遵行基督的命令去使萬民作主的門徒，而不是浪費時間去照顧因罪而被敗壞，最終在基督再來時將被毀滅的物質世界。拯救靈魂，而非地球！」本工作坊將提供全面的聖經與神學視角，幫助我們重新認識教會對創造物的護理使命。關愛受造界並非與福音分離，而是福音本質的核心之一。</details>

**講員 Speaker：[池峈鋒博士](#池峈鋒博士)**

<details>
<summary> A4: 自閉-特殊兒童與教會-從歡迎到接納的神學 </summary>

特需-殘障兒童包括那些長期罹患身體、精神、智力或感官障礙的兒童，這些障礙使他們無法在一個平等的基礎上充分有效地參與社會。這其中，自閉症(ASD)是美國及全球增長最快的神經發育障礙。過去三十年診斷出來的發病率的指數級增長，其意義對於基督教社群是顯而易見的：ASD不再被認為是罕見的，而是相對常見的，而且大多數社區都在某種程度上被其影響。儘管自閉症日益增多，基督徒群體在神學、身體和態度上的壁壘卻持續存在，這對自閉症患者及其家庭並不友好。

該工作坊由兩部分組成，將闡明解決這些障礙的可行途徑，旨在支持自閉症兒童，使其能夠有意義地參與教會群體的社交活動，反之亦然。本工作坊力圖更新我們的神學視角和互動姿態，以糾正刻板印象和對自閉症兒童的邊緣化 </details>

**講員 Speaker：[劉浩宇博士](#劉浩宇博士)**

<details>
<summary> A5: Service as Christian Formation: Learning to Walk with Jesus in this World </summary>

A professor at the Jesuit school in San Francisco observes that our world is facing an epistemological crisis. We don't know what is true, what is false, or who is creating the categories about which we argue. Pastors face the unfortunate reality that their congregations are being formed by 24 hour bombardment of news, social media and distracting infotainment. The church in many cases has responded by reducing itself to a weekly pep talk and concert performance. Not surprisingly, churches and synagogues are quickly greying and emptying and the future is not clear. But many of those who won't set foot in a church are actively involved in ministry and have a hunger for the things of God.

In this context, God still claims to be the ultimate authority, but seems to engage with us through the still small voice we hear when we form relationships in our service. In this workshop, we will look at examples of churches and service organizations that engage in mission in San Francisco and observe how serving has changed people and formed their sense of who they are. We warn you ahead of time that we have not solved any of the culture war questions. Instead, we will describe how working together in community forms people and strengthens their spirits in ways that many of our faith institutions have steered away from. </details>

### 工作坊 B Workshops B
<details>
<summary> B1: Three-Self Principles in China - History of the Expansion of Christianity into Asia </summary>

In this workshop, I will discuss the principles of a self-governing, self-propagating and self-
supporting national church. These principles were first developed in the 1850s by Henry Venn in
Britain and Rufus Anderson in the United States independently of each other. The goal of the
Three-Selfs was to produce an independent, indigenous national church: 1) that was governed by
national leaders and not foreign missionaries; 2) that was not (overly) dependent on foreign
funds to financially support national church leaders and institutions; and 3) that was propagating

the gospel both locally and cross-culturally. Ironically, the missionary slogan of the Three-Selfs
was utilized by the Chinese Communist government in the Three Self Patriotic Movement. In
this workshop, we will first address the historical background and forerunners to the Three-Selfs.
Next, we will examine a pivotal document by Henry Venn entitled “The Organization of Native
Churches” (1861). After a brief discussion of Venn’s implementation of the Three-Selfs in
Nigeria and Sierra Leone, we will turn to a more fulsome discussion of the partial adoption of the
Three-Selfs by Hudson Taylor and the China Inland Mission, and their complete adoption by
John Nevius in China and by the American Presbyterian Mission in Korea. The Three-Self
principles continue to have relevancy for church planting and the doing of mission today. </details>

**講員 Speaker：[Dr. Alice Ott](#dr-alice-ott)**

<details>
<summary>  B2: Sowing Seeds and Planting Hope: From the Desert to the City </summary>

The workshop introduces the important role which the Church can play in Creation Care, especially in the current climate crisis. The community of faith can point the world from a human-centred consumerist mindset to the role of humans intended by the Creator God. The gospel of Christ proclaims the redemptive work of Christ for the transformation of cosmos from creation to the new creation in Christ, reflecting His supremacy over all things as the all in all. As such, the Church can help recover the cultural mandate as well as the mission mandate commissioned by God in our call to action in response to the climate challenges, whether in the desert or in the city. </details>

**講員 Speaker：[Pastor Lawrence Ko](#pastor-lawrence-ko)**

<details>
<summary> B3: 真實的連結-天國使命的結合 </summary>

本研究从基督教福音派的视角出发，探讨“连结神学”的概念及其在沟通与领导中的关键作用。在当今关系日益疏离的时代，这一神学强调人与神、人与人之间的连结的重要性。研究假设指出，缺乏有意义的关系和连结，无法实现高效的沟通表达或领导能力。“连结神学”为恢复关系深度与意义提供了圣经的蓝图，并能有效地改善沟通与领导的实践。通过将互动根植于圣经原则，个人和群体能够在使命中获得属灵的成长和现实的成效。这一神学理念不仅应对了现代社会的疏离问题，还为领导者和沟通者提供了切实可行的解决方案。</details>

**講員 Speaker：[吴子平牧師/博士](#吴子平牧師博士)**

<details>
<summary> B4: Innovate Fearlessly for Missions </summary>

Global missions need innovation. When we think about how we are going to reach people who are unreached and engage our churches, especially those with marketplace skills (especially those of the next generation who are digital nativess), how are we going to harness their ideas and resources to think differently and bring fresh, new ideas to impact global missions? This workshop will introduce innovation methods, design thinking, and different digital strategies to help take the Gospel to new people, places, and spaces. </details>

**講員 Speaker：[Mr. Nick Wu](#mr-nick-wu)**

<details>
<summary> B5: Autism-Special Needs and the Church - The Practice from Welcoming to Accepting </summary>

Children with special needs – disabilities include those with “long-term physical, mental,
intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their
full and effective participation in society on an equal basis”. Of the various disabilities, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing neuro-developmental disability in the US and around the world. For Christian communities, the significance of this exponential increase of
diagnosed incidence over the last three decades is obvious: ASD “is no longer considered rare
but … relatively common, and the likelihood is that most communities are affected in some way
by it”. Despite ASD’s prevalence, Christian communities unfortunately remain hostile spaces for autistic individuals and their families through the persistent presence of theological, physical, and attitudinal barriers.

This two-part workshop will articulate plausible paths to address these barriers, with the goal of
supporting autistic children meaningfully participate in the social life of the church community
and vice versa. This session explores practices that create welcoming spaces in our
churches for autistic children to inhabit, belong, and thrive. Hopefully, through these sessions,
we will be nudged toward the re-shaping of our values, capacities, and postures such that our
communities move away from ableism and reflect inclusion of and accessibility for autistic
children. </details>

#### Dr. Alice Ott
![Dr. Alice Ott](/images/babc/2025/Alice-Ott.jpg)

I was raised as one of six daughters in a devout Roman Catholic family in Akron, Ohio. I
attended Catholic schools from the first grade through grade twelve. It was during my freshman
year at Ohio University that evangelical Christians shared the gospel with me, and during the
following summer, I accepted Christ. I spent my junior year at the University of Edinburgh in
Scotland. While there, I attended a mission meeting where I responded to the challenge to
commit my life to missions. To prepare for that goal, after I completed my degree at Ohio
University, I attended Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (TEDS) and earned a Master of
Divinity in Missions. There I also met my husband, Craig Ott, who was likewise pursuing a
missionary career. After our marriage, and a two-year church planting ministry in Illinois, we
joined the Evangelical Free Church Mission (now ReachGlobal). We served in Germany for
twenty years in church planting and theological education. In 2002 Craig accepted the position as
a Missions professor at TEDS, and I began my PhD in Church History and graduated in 2008.
Since then, I was first an adjunct professor, and since 2012 an affiliate professor of the History of
Mission and World Christianity. I have published two books and numerous articles on Church
History and Mission History. Craig and I have three married sons on three continents: Germany,
United States, and Tanzania, where our youngest son and his family are missionaries.

Born and raised in San Francisco’s Mission District. Growing up in a neighborhood shaped by recent immigrants, he learned the gift of hospitality from his neighbors. As he grew older and learned about U.S. immigration laws, he found it unjust that our nation chooses to be inhospitable to the migrant and indigenous communities that taught him hospitality in the first place. Justin graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in Linguistics. He took the summer after college to visit Guatemala and learn Spanish as part of his goal to be more hospitable to Central American immigrants arriving in the Bay Area. He joined the Jubilee team because he wanted to advocate for the immigrant community in the Bay Area in a more substantial and sustained way.
