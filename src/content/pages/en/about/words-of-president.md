Dear Faithful Supporters of CWTS,

<p class="indent-8">Warm greetings in the Lord! May the joy and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Luke Tsai, President of Christian Witness
Theological Seminary (基督工人神學院, CWTS). I am writing to introduce you to our seminary
and share with you the opportunities God has given us to train up future leaders of the church
and missionaries around the world.</p>

<p class="indent-8">CWTS was established in 1973 by the late Rev. Moses Yu (于力工牧師) to raise up
godly, dedicated ministers (“workers”) for the Chinese church. As the only ATS (Association of
Theological Schools) accredited Chinese seminary in the Bay Area, CWTS differentiates itself
from other Chinese seminaries by providing rigorous and quality training in Bible/theology,
ministry skills and, most importantly, spiritual formation. The seminary has recognized the
importance of spiritual life development since its founding. We have consistently devoted a vast
amount of resources and attention to ensure every student makes significant progress towards
Christlikeness during their studies. Our focus on spiritual formation is among the strongest
across all seminaries. I have provided our seminary brochure for more information about our
school.</p>

<p class="indent-8">We currently have over 250 students around the world, enrolled in masters and doctoral
level studies. Our alumni have served or are currently serving in most Chinese churches in the
Bay Area. In the last four years alone, our graduates began ministering in forty different Chinese
churches and Christian organizations in the Bay Area. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p class="indent-8">The 2020 global pandemic brought both opportunities, challenges and concerns. First,
one of the most exciting opportunities is the ability to train “workers” (“工人”) all over the
world, especially places where quality theological education is inaccessible. Through the
internet, we are now able to raise up workers in restricted areas such as Russia and China, and
parts of the US where no Chinese seminaries exist. In the last two years, we have already started
to admit students from these areas, who otherwise would not have opportunities to receive proper
training. As the word continues to spread, we believe this number will increase significantly in
the coming years, so that we can reach the billions of souls in these restricted areas.</p>

<p class="indent-8">Second, through the internet we are now able to provide much needed training to existing
and future Chinese missionaries around the world. Most of these missionaries (numbering in the
thousands) went to the field out of their passion for evangelism but have not received formal
training. We are planning to offer a new flexible and “stackable” training program for them
starting in 2025, so that these missionaries can be trained towards effective ministry in
evangelism, discipleship, church planting, and self-care. (Self-care is critically needed among
missionaries to reduce burnout and heal from discouragement and frustration.)</p>

<p class="indent-8">Third, as churches continue to grow and re-emerge from the pandemic, it is becoming
clear that congregation aging (教會老化) and the lack of well-trained workers are two of the
most pressing challenges. Churches desperately need younger pastors to attract and shepherd
young professionals. We frequently receive pastoral position job posts these few years. Thanks
be to God, in addition to the increase of online students, we also received a record number of
international student enrollment, students who came physically to our San Jose campus. Most of
these students are young (in their 20s and 30s) but have already had many years of full-time
ministry experience. Once trained, we will be able to supply the Bay Area with much sought-
after young and spirited ministers, who will one day become leaders or planters of churches.</p>

<p class="indent-8">However, the popularity of online theological education brings about one significant
concern—how do we ensure the spiritual formation of online students? Most online students in
many seminaries can obtain their degrees simply by finishing their courses, without needing to
go through a rigorous life transformation process. Churches are at risk of being led by ministers
who are spiritually immature and weak, bringing more harm than good to the church. To address
this concern, our online programs have been carefully designed to ensure proper spiritual
formation of online students. As well, for most of our online classes, our instructors hold Q&amp;A
sessions with our students live through Zoom several times a semester. These interactions bolster
teacher-student relationships and allow teachers to care for students’ specific needs.</p>

<p class="indent-8">These new opportunities also brought new challenges and needs for the seminary. First,
most of the online international students are unable to afford the US tuition rate. As a result, a
large amount of scholarships have to be issued to them. Second, the increase of students calls for
us to hire additional faculty members. Many of our existing faculty members have been carrying
loads beyond the maximum. Third, currently, our existing dormitory space is filled to capacity
and additional space is urgently needed. Fourth, our current campus, an old building, puts great
restrictions on our ability to conduct hybrid modes of instruction (i.e., in-person and online
simultaneous instruction). The campus also has a number of other major limitations, such as size
being too small, low ceiling, lack of outdoor space, and poor layout. The long term vision is to
acquire a larger and newer building to meet the current needs and facilitate future growth of the
seminary.</p>

The following table outlines the funds we need to raise:

1.  Student Scholarships/Tuition Discounts \
    50 students @ 10 credit hours per year @ $250 per credit hour \
    Total: $125,000/year
2.  Additional Two Faculty Hirings \
    Salary with benefits: $160-200k/year (depending on levels and experience)
3.  Campus and Dormitory Upgrade and Upkeep
    - Existing dormitory kitchen and bathroom replacement: $50,000
    - Campus classroom renovation for hybrid education: $180,000
    - Campus AV system replacement: $50,000
    - Campus HVAC replacement: $100,000
    - Total: $380,000
4.  Dorm Addition \
    We are currently (May 2024) selling a condo and purchasing a larger property that will
    house at least 10 additional students and family members. The amount we need to raise is
    around $1,400,000.
5.  Campus Expansion/Purchase \
    We are in the process of planning a campus expansion to secure the needs of the
    seminary as we continue to grow. Our existing campus was converted from an old office
    building that has significant constraints (such as low ceiling and rigid layout) that greatly
    restrict our teaching, activities and events. We hope to build or acquire a campus that has
    the following specifications:
    - Size 25,000-30,000 sq ft
    - High ceiling (~20+ft)
    - Flexible layout (for classrooms, offices, auditorium, library, etc.)
    - At least 50 parking spaces

<p class="indent-8">Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and get to know more about CWTS. If
you have additional questions, I am happy to correspond with you through email or meet with
you in person or over Zoom. Thank you for recognizing the importance of seminary training.
This ministry is especially valuable because it carries a multiplicative effect—every “worker” we
raise up will be able to strengthen several churches and disciple hundreds and even thousands of
believers. As the return of the Lord draws near, it is imperative that we capture all these
opportunities so that we can do our best to rescue souls in the last day!</p>

<p class="indent-8">May the Lord be with you every moment and fill your cup with His blessings until it
overflows.</p>

Blessings in Christ,
