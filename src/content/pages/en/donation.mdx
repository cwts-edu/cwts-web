Dear brothers and sisters, we are delighted that the Spirit of the Lord has inspired you to open this page in response to His calling for you to support CWTS monetarily and also in prayer. Thank you for partnering with us in our quest to fulfill our mission of "cultivating workers for the Kingdom of God".

“The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike. 1 Samuel 30:24b).

The faculty, staff, and student body of CWTS are deeply grateful for your gracious support.
