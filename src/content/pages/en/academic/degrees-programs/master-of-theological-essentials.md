**(3 years, 36 credit hours)**

The purpose of the Master of Theological Essentials (MTE) is to provide students with a solid foundation for Christian faith and thought, regardless of their vocational or ministerial calling. Students focus on learning biblical books and develop essential theological skills in order to apply them in their life and ministry contexts, within and beyond the church.\
The MTE does not attempt to prepare a student for a vocational or ministerial role in the church, but aims at providing the biblical and theological foundation needed for all ministry. All the biblical and theological (as well as general studies and field education) courses of the MTE program overlap with those of other CWTS Master's degrees (Master of Christian Ministry, Master of Biblical Studies, Master of Divinity). This allows students not only to transfer all 36 credit-hours to another Master's program after completing the degree, but also to progress to other degree programs which have focused vocational or ministerial training. \ 
The learning outcomes for an MTE graduate include: (1) demonstrating a foundational grasp of the biblical contents, contexts, and messages; and the ability to conduct graduate-level biblical research that can translate into practice; (2) exhibiting essential understanding of the heritage of Christian faith and its historical developments; and an ability in theological research, reflection, and discussion that fosters Christ-like maturity and/or Christian ministry.
