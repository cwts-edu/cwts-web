Dr. Manchiu Cheung (hereafter Dr. Lau) grew up in Hong Kong. She accepted Christ in high school and served actively in church. After graduation from college, she became a staff member of the Fellowship of Evangelical Students (Hong Kong) to promote evangelism among high school students. In 1972 she married Dr. Wilkin Cheung whom she got to know in college. After their wedding, Wilkin taught at Singapore University and Dr. Lau studied at Discipleship Training Centre (Singapore) where she earned a diploma in theology. Later Wilkin accepted an offer from the Chinese University of Hong Kong where he eventually became an Associate Professor in Biology. After their return to Hong Kong, Dr. Lau taught high school for more than ten years and participated actively in student evangelism, leading Bible studies and fellowships. She later became the principal of a high school.

Sensing the call from God, .she resigned from the school and became a full time seminarian, eventually earning her Master in Divinity. She then became a teacher at the Bible Seminary of Hong Kong. Later she pursued a doctorate degree, majoring in Adult Christian Education.

In 1999, Dr. Lau and her husband Wilkin immigrated to California. Since then, Dr. Lau has served as a professor in CWTS, teaching courses mainly in Christian Education but also in Evangelism, Bible Study, Spiritual Growth, etc. Dr. Lau was formerly the Registrar and Director of Field Education in CWTS. Currently she serves as the Director of Human Resources, oversees the Finance Department, and is also involved in Advancement in CWTS.

For a number of years, Dr. Lau has been attending Tri-Valley Chinese Bible Church and teaches Adult Sunday School for the Chinese congregation. For his part, Wilkin was a long time teacher of adults in the English Sunday School. Besides being dedicated to teaching and research in college settings, he was also committed to the integration of science and the Christian faith, and he fully supported Dr. Lau’s ministry. Unfortunately he passed away in March 2013 as a result of cancer. Since then, while missing her husband, Dr. Lau continues to serve the Lord.
