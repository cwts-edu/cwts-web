Before entering full-time ministry, Dr. Luke Tsai worked for fifteen years as an engineer in the Silicon Valley, designing microprocessors at Advanced Micro Devices. He was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the U.S. when he was thirteen. He completed his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley and M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.

Even though Dr. Tsai enjoyed a successful engineering career, his true passion has always been to serve the Lord and teach God’s word. He devoted his time outside of work to the church, serving in various capacities, particularly in youth group and Sunday school. After receiving a call to full-time ministry in 2006, he promptly moved to Dallas, TX and began receiving his training at Dallas Theological Seminary, where he earned both the Master of Theology degree and Doctor of Philosophy. In 2013, Dr. Tsai and his wife, Jackie, returned to the Bay Area to serve at their home church, the Home of Christ Church in Menlo Park. Dr. Tsai joined CWTS in 2015 as a faculty in New Testament.

Dr. Tsai and his wife Jackie have two daughters, Dorothy and Susannah. In his spare time, he enjoys playing the violin, table tennis, and basketball.
