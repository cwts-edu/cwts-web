Kevin Chen is a second-generation Chinese-American (ABC) who returned to his hometown of San Jose to teach at CWTS in July 2019. For the previous nine years, he taught biblical studies at Union University, which is a Christian liberal arts university in Jackson, TN. His research, teaching, and writing have focused on the Old Testament and Hebrew, although his interests also include biblical studies, hermeneutics, and biblical theology. Before beginning his Ph.D. studies and while doing M.Div. studies part-time at Western Seminary, he worked as an electrical engineer for three years in the Silicon Valley.

Kevin has spent many years in Chinese and Asian-American churches, which he has served in the areas of leadership, preaching, and teaching. Through his nine years in Tennessee and one year of Ph.D. study at Southeastern Seminary in North Carolina, he has also lived in the American South for ten years.

Kevin is married to Joyce, and they have one daughter (Kristina) and one son (Joel). He enjoys spending time with his family, exercise, travel, reading, learning languages, and following Bay Area sports teams.
