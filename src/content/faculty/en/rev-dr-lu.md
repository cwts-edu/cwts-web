Rev. Lu was formerly a college professor. In 1988, he received God’s clear call to full-time ministry after his son passed away. Thus he enrolled in Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Chicago where he eventually obtained his Master in Divinity and Doctor of Philosophy. Rev. Lu majored in Old Testament, but he also studied Exegesis, Theology, and Semitic Languages. He has a burden for expounding the Bible and theology, church edification, leadership training, as well as theological education. Rev. Lu knows the importance of publishing in ministry. Besides publishing academic works such as his commentary on Isaiah, he regularly contributes to a column on Faith and Current Affairs in Magazine of the Evangelical Formosan Church.

Rev. Lu was previously Senior Pastor in Atlanta Chinese Christian Church where he paid attention to the nurturance of believers, prayer, spiritual growth, worship, education and missions. Chief among his many hobbies is singing songs in Hebrew. He is also very fond of gardening, but acts less than what he plans and says. Rev. Lu’s wife Betty received her Doctor of Christian Education from Talbot School of Theology in southern California. She majors in Christian Education and Family Ministry. Their daughter, son-in-law and grandchild live in Boston, MA.
