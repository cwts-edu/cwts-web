Besides being preoccupied with teaching and administrative work in CWTS, Rev. Ip is also regularly invited by many churches to preach in Sunday services and retreats. During such times, he shares on the Christian faith, spiritual growth and life applications from the Bible. He has also published many articles in Christian books and magazines.

Rev. Ip’s wife is a community nurse within Hospice service by providing emotional care and support to patients through home visitations. The Ip’s have two grown up sons, living independently in other states. Rev. Ip’s hobbies are reading, traveling, as well as sharing his experiences and life lessons with friends.

In the past, Rev. Ip has a lot of experience learning different languages. In order to study the Old Testament thoroughly, he learned languages such as German, French, Hebrew, Modern Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, Akkadian, Ugaritic and Arabic. Through his study of different languages, he has accumulated a vast knowledge of traditions and expressions of cultures past and present all over the world. This has correspondingly borne fruit in his exegesis and application of Scripture.
