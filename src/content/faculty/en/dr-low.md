Dr. Low was born in Malaysia and immigrated to Singapore with his parents at the age of ten. In 1997, he heard the Lord’s calling, and in 2005, he went to the United States for theological training — completing his studies at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and Biola University.

He has held teaching, training, and leadership positions at the Ministry of Education in Singapore, Biola University, Concordia University Chicago, Raffles Christian International School (Indonesia), and William Carey International University. He has also served in various churches in Southern California and Singapore, assisting in pulpit ministries in both Mandarin and English.

His research focuses on cross-cultural education, the religious identity of Buddhist and Taoist adherents, and contextualized mission strategies. Dr. Low and his wife, Melody, have five children: Megan, Malcolm, Meryl, Mitchell, and Meredith.
