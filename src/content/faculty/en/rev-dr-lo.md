Born in Taiwan and converted after graduating from college, Pastor Andrew Lo came to the United States in 1992 to study Environmental Engineering. After graduated, he worked in Houston for 10 years. In 2004, in response to God’s call, he received his Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Master of Theology (Th.M.) degrees from Logos
Evangelical Seminary, majoring in Old Testament Studies. In 2021, because of the burden of building up younger ministers, he joined the faculty of Christian Witness
Theological Seminary (CWTS). He is also currently a candidate of Doctor of Ministry (D.Min) at CWTS. Pastor Lo is committed to family ministry, discipleship, hermeneutics,
biblical studies, worship and praise, and other areas. Pastor Lo and his wife, Jessie Lo, have two children, a boy and a girl (Alan and Karen), and they have a wonderful
partnership for ministry.

Pastor Lo enjoys playing and watching basketball, baseball, foosball, playing guitar, listening to music, going to nature and parks, and cherishing time with his family.
