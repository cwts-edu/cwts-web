Dr. Jacob Cheung was born in Xingning (Guangdong, China), grew up in Hong Kong, and studied in Hong Kong, United Kingdom and USA. He was converted at Hong Kong Bethel Church where he also received God’s call to full-time ministry. By God’s grace, he can speak three Chinese dialects: Cantonese, Mandarin and Hakka. His hobbies include singing as well as studying Chinese history and literature in addition to the Bible, often enraptured in the world of the ancients. Rev. Tsang married in 1980 and has three children as a result. Currently, his family members all live overseas outside China. Besides teaching in CWTS, he also preaches in different churches, publishes papers in journal, is involved in leadership training, and assists editorial work for the Old Testament section of the Tien Dao Bible Commentary Series. May God’s grace richly abound in China!
