Pastor Kenny Lai was originally from Taiwan. He has a hi-tech professional background with an U.S. patent in addition. After more than ten years working in the industry, he received God’s call to full-time ministry and entered seminary to equip himself. Eventually he received a Ph.D. from Dallas Theological Seminary, majoring in the New Testament. While attending seminary, he was also involved in pastoral ministry in a local church. Convinced that theological education is vital to the spread of the kingdom of God, since 2006 he is engaged in teaching in seminaries to train workers after God’s heart to serve Him in this generation.

Besides teaching in seminary, Rev. Lai also preaches in different churches, participates in lay training, and publishes articles. In his leisure, Rev. Lai enjoys hiking to explore the beauty of God’s creation. He also loves gardening; though he does not have “green fingers,” his backyard occasionally produces seasonal fruits for picking. Mrs. Lai is also a preacher with a Master’s degree in Biblical Studies. She has been invited many times to teach on effective personal evangelism, for she has a special passion for, and experience in, personal evangelism.
