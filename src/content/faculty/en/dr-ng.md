Dr. Esther Ng grew up in a Christian family in Hong Kong. While studying at Hong Kong University, she received God’s call to full time Christian ministry. After obtaining her bachelor’s degree in Science, and teaching for two years at a high school, she left Hong Kong and received theological education in the United States. Afterwards she returned to Hong Kong and served for 17 years at the China Graduate School of Theology in teaching and editing. In 1995 she resigned and pursued further studies at Aberdeen University in Britain where she examined how the feminist theologian Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza attempted to reconstruct women’s role in early Christianity. After obtaining her Ph.D. she emigrated to the U.S.A. In 2000-2003 she taught New Testament courses at Wheaton College. Since 2003, she has served in various capacities at Christian Witness Theological Seminary. She retired from her full-time position in 2016 and has been Senior Adjunct Professor since then. In addition to teaching and writing, she plays the piano occasionally at church services and enjoys writing poems.
