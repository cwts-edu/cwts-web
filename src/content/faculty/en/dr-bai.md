Dr. Yucheng Bai was born in Nanjing, China, and went through a thoroughly secular public education in China. In high school he began to develop doubts of the atheist worldview in which he was raised, and he began to explore religious history on his own. When he came to the United States as an international student, he encountered Jesus through the witness of campus ministries and became a Christian at the age of 20. Afterwards he continued to pursue graduate studies in church history. His research interests are Chinese and American church histories, political theology, Christianity and democracy etc. He and his wife are preparing to plant a church in North Carolina. Outside of work, he enjoys cooking and traveling.
