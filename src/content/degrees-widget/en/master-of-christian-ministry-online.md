# Master of Christian Ministry Online（3 years，60 credit hours）

The online Master of Christian Ministry program is designed for distance students, and its courses and degrees are the same as the MCM onsite program. The difference is that the online program is divided into three semesters: Fall, Spring and Summer. The MCM online does not have a concentration but students may choose any Practical Electives (4 credits).
